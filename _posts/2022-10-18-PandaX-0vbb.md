Neutrinoless double beta decay $0 \nu bb$ decay is a rare process, which could prove the Majorana nature of the neutrino.
The analysis of it largely depends on the energy (spectrum) of the 2 electrons in the final state.
However, the graphic pattern of their emitted photons might also tell us some useful information.

We focused on the Cerenkov photons.
In Cerenkov radiation, photons are emitted with some fixed emission angle, and thus form a Cerenkov cone.
This should shown as a ring patter on the detector.
We worked on the optics simulation generated by BambooMC, a Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation program.
