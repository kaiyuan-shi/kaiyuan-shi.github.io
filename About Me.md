Hello, my name is Kaiyuan Shi, and I prefer people to call me Sky, which are also the initial letters of my Chinese name.
I am currently working as a research assistant in professor [Dingyu Shao's Research Group](https://shaodingyu.github.io/) at Fudan University and [QCD Theory Group](https://kang-research-group.physics.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. My current project is on the azimuthal correlation of isolated photon-hadron production in pp and pA collisions.

I received my B.S. in Physics from University of California- Los Angeles in 2022.
My interests are in the elementary particles that make up our universe, and I am passionate about both experiments and theories in this field.
During my undergraduate years, I have worked both in experimental group at [PandaX](https://pandax.sjtu.edu.cn/) and theoretical groups in [QCD](https://kang-research-group.physics.ucla.edu/), please see [Projects](https://kaiyuan-shi.github.io/Projects/) for some more detailed introduction of what I did.
I enjoyed both research experiences and learned a lot of from these communities: experiences, Physics, toolkits, and met with excellent people.
I am always ready to explore more.

By the way, I also enjoy philosophy.
My favorite philosophers are Plato and Nietzsche (my apologies to some philosophy students).
I think Physics contains great philosophy and aesthetics.
<em>Formulas are the poetry of math.</em>
